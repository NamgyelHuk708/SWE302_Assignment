## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM Priority)

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Brute force attacks, DoS, resource exhaustion  

**Mitigation Plan:**
- Implement rate limiting middleware before production
- Recommended: `gin-contrib/ratelimit`
- Limits:
  - Login: 5 attempts per minute per IP
  - Article creation: 10 per hour per user
  - General API: 100 requests per minute per user

**Timeline:** Implement before production deployment

**Justification for Current State:**
- Development environment only
- Not critical for assignment demonstration
- Documented for future implementation
- Does not affect current security grade

---

### 2. Code Quality Issues (LOW Priority)

**Backend (72 issues):**
- Unhandled errors: 23
- Potential nil pointers: 12
- Cognitive complexity: 18 functions
- Code duplication: 15 instances

**Frontend (700 issues):**
- Missing PropTypes: 145
- Unhandled promises: 87
- Code duplication: 98
- Complex functions: 75

**Status:** DOCUMENTED  
**Risk Level:** LOW (no security impact)  
**Impact:** Maintainability and reliability

**Mitigation:**
- All issues documented in SonarQube reports
- No security vulnerabilities
- Technical debt quantified
- Future refactoring plan available
